I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Agricultural, Environmental, and Development Economics at The Ohio State University](https://aede.osu.edu). 

My research addresses issues at the intersection of agricultural and environmental economics. My work often leverages administrative surveys and spatial data from citizen science projects and remote sensing products to study the production of food and agricultural commodities through sustainable means. Some ongoing projects include evaluating the effectiveness of Clean Water Act regulations on livestock production and the Conservation Reserve Program in supporting ecosystem services. 

I obtained my Ph.D. in [Economics at Iowa State University](https://www.econ.iastate.edu), and was a postdoctoral research associate at the [Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management at Cornell University](https://dyson.cornell.edu) prior to joining AEDE.
